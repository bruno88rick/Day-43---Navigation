/*Programmatic navigation allows us to move from one view to another just using code, rather than waiting for the user to take a specific action. For example, maybe your app is busy processing some user input and you want to navigate to a result screen when that work is finished â€“ you want the navigation to happen automatically when you say so, rather than as a direct response to user input*/
